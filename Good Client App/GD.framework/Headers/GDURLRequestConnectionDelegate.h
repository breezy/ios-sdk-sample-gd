/** Delegate for managing the URL connections associated with a UIWebView control.
 * Connections for URL requests issued by a <TT>UIWebView</TT> control can be
 * managed by creating a class that implements this protocol.
 *
 * This protocol enables the application to specify whether a connection will be
 * made direct to the Internet or via the Good Dynamics proxy infrastructure,
 * or that a connection is to be blocked. The application will be notified
 * separately before and after each connection is made.
 *
 * Use this protocol when the application requires finer control over routing
 * and filtering than is offered by Good Control client connection
 * configuration. But note that this protocol does not enable routing to an
 * application server that is behind the enterprise firewall and that has not
 * been configured in the enterprise Good Control console.
 * 
 * Call the <TT>GDSetRequestConnectionDelegate:</TT> function in the
 * \link UIWebView(GDNET)\endlink category to set the delegate for a particular
 * <TT>UIWebView</TT> instance. The delegate callbacks will be executed on the
 * same thread in which the delegate was set.
 *
 * The callbacks in this protocol utilize an <TT>NSURLRequest</TT> object to
 * represent the request to which the callback invocation relates. See the <A
 *     HREF="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSURLRequest_Class/Reference/Reference.html"
 *     target="_blank"
 * >NSURLRequest class reference</A> in the iOS Developer Library on apple.com
 * for details of how to access its attributes.
 *
 * \see \ref GC and the online help available in the Good Control console.
